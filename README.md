# Whatsapp for Old Mac OS
This project is an unofficial, personal-use build of WhatsApp Web packaged into an Electron application. It is not affiliated with, endorsed, or maintained by WhatsApp or Meta. The purpose of this build is purely non-commercial, created for convenience and accessibility.

Technically speaking, the app is essentially a WebView wrapper that loads the existing WhatsApp Web interface inside an Electron shell. It does not alter WhatsApp’s services or provide additional features beyond what is available through the web version.

For this particular build:

Chromium engine: 108.0.5359.215

Electron version: 22.3.27

Node.js version: 16.17.1

Operating system: macOS Mojave 10.14.6

Hardware: MacBook Pro Early 2011

The intention behind this setup is to provide a practical way for users on older macOS systems—which can no longer run the official WhatsApp desktop app—to continue using WhatsApp in a desktop-like environment. Since these machines can still run browsers that support WhatsApp Web, wrapping the web experience inside Electron keeps it accessible without requiring users to constantly rely on a browser tab.

In short, this is not a replacement for the official app, but a friendly workaround for older Macs, ensuring users can stay connected while extending the usability of legacy hardware.
